This repository contains the code for creating stimuli and data analysis as described in Zarkali et al. Increased weighting on prior knowledge in Lewy-Body associated visual hallucinations. Brain Communications 2019 (in press). 
Feel free to use or adjust any of the code; should you do so kindly reference the above paper.

We have also included the stimuli we used during our experiment. These were selected from a pool of created stimuli through pilot testing to ensure they were not too easy to discriminate without prior knowledge but that they could create a strong percept once prior knowledge is provided. Detailed information on the stimulus creation and piloting is included in the published paper. 
The created stimuli are again free to use, kindly reference should you do so.


## File description:


### Mooney Converter:
Executable python script that creates 500x500pixel Mooney images from any coloured template. 
This has the final parameters chosen for stimulus creation after pilot testing.
The script can be used as is with a specified path 

### Priors Analysis: 
Jupyter notebook used for all data analysis. 
Due to patient confidentially the dataset has not been included in the repository at this time. 
To use this notebook the path to datasets needs to be defined. 
Otherwise the individual shells can be used separetely adjusted for your dataset.

### Test.zip:
Stimuli used during the test session (prior to main experiment).

### MainExperiment.zip:
Stimuli used during the main experiement; note that stimuli were randomly selected to be presented over 6 experimental sessions.
